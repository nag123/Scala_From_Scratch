 *THIS PROGRAM IS ABOUT SCALA LIBRARY FOR AKKA STREAMS
 *
 * REACTIVE STREAM : to process an unbounded amount of data in an async , backpressured way
 * PUBLISHER : An entity that emits aync(single directional) , unbounded amount of data
 * SUBSCRIBER: A sink that receives elements
 * PROCESSOR : In between PUBLISHER AND SUBSCRIBER we have processor which is a transformer that can manipulate the data as it
 *              flows through the reactive stream
 *
 * NOTE : Here everything is async means nothing depends on the other for its action
 *        Reactive streams is a SPI (Service Provider Interface - https://www.reactive-streams.org/) not an API
 *
 * HINTS : backpressured - Can slow down the fast producer when the consumer is very slow



 ON THE GO ERRORS :
 I spent almost 5 hours on fixing the sbt part
